This website is a _[hyperlinked twin][hyperlinked twins]_ of the [Spoofax] project repository
shown at the top right.

!!! note ""

    The icons :material-lightbulb: and :material-lightbulb-outline: toggle between light and dark mode.

Hyperlinked twins support _precise name-based code navigation_ using ordinary web browsers:

- Simply click on a name reference to jump to the corresponding declaration.
- Hover[^mobile] over a name to show the location of the declaration.
- Click on a declaration to jump to the first reference to it (if any),
  or hover over it to show the locations of all the (direct) references to it.

[^mobile]: Mobile devices with touch screens don't usually recognise hovering gestures.

The sources of the webpages were generated by Spoofax from raw code,
in the same way as for other [hyperlinked twins].
The aim is for a future release of Spoofax to support generation of hyperlinked twins
for code in all [Spoofax meta-languages].

!!! warning

    The Spoofax implementation and the generated website have not yet been reviewed by the Spoofax developers.
